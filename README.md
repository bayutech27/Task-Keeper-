# Task-Keeper-
This web app is a v1.0 of my To Do list app.
Once a task is entered in the input space, the 'Add' button automatically adds the task to the list when clicked.
Each task can be marked as done or complete when clicked. A red line strikes through the completed task and its color turns gray.
The delete button can be used to remove any task from the list.
The task list container automatically grows as task list increases.
Improvement that can be done on the app includes the addition of check button in front of each task to mark complete, congratulations sound everytime a task is marked complete, date and time a task is added, progress bar showing number of tasks entered and number of tasks completed.
